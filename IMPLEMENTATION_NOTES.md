## Implementation Details

### Diagnostics Module
The diagnostics module provides functions to check various aspects of the wireless adapter and identify potential issues. It uses a combination of system commands and configuration file analysis to determine the adapter's status.

### Fixes Module
The fixes module implements solutions for common issues with the Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 adapter. It includes functions to reset the adapter, unblock it if blocked by rfkill, configure optimal driver parameters, and update firmware.

### Adapter Info Module
The adapter info module retrieves and displays information about the wireless adapter, including its status, configuration, and specifications.

### User Interface
The user interface is implemented as a menu-based system that guides the user through the diagnostic and fix processes. It provides clear options and feedback on operations.

### Testing
Unit tests are provided for the diagnostics and fixes modules to ensure their functionality. The tests use mocking to simulate system commands and verify the behavior of the functions.

## Usage Workflow

1. The user runs the application with administrative privileges
2. The main menu displays options for diagnostics, fixes, and network management
3. The user selects an option to diagnose issues or apply fixes
4. The application performs the requested operation and displays the results
5. The user can then choose to apply fixes for identified issues or perform other operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enterprise WiFi Support**
   - Implementation of EAP-TLS, PEAP, and TTLS authentication
   - Certificate management

2. **Multi-Connection Management**
   - Load balancing multiple connections
   - Failover configuration
   - Traffic routing rules

3. **Regulatory Domain Handling**
   - Region-specific channel restrictions
   - Transmit power compliance
   - Dynamic regulatory domain handling

4. **Captive Portal Detection**
   - Portal detection without online services
   - Authentication helpers
   - Session management

5. **Advanced Troubleshooting**
   - Packet capture and analysis
   - Connection timing diagnostics
   - Interference detection
